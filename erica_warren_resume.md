# Summary
Looking to join a team providing business intelligence solutions from conception through deployment and beyond.

Basically I love helping people use technology to make their work more efficient. Let's make computers do the things they are good at, so we can free up people to do the things *they* are good at. I have experience in all aspects of the process: discovery and gathering user requirements, development, documentation and training materials, live training sessions, ad-hoc support, responding to user feedback, etc.

## Quotes
"I express some desire ('If only there were some way of doing ____') and Erica asks some questions, refines the needs and goals, then goes about meeting the challenge. And it's all done quickly, efficiently, and pragmatically: real-world solutions to real-world problems."
--from manager's 2013 performance review at HBG

"Erica is a natural leader within the department. Her knowledge and expertise inspire confidence (among junior members of the department but also editors and Production associates) but she remains easily approachable and easy to talk to. It's one of the reasons she's so effective as the ebook liaison between Man Ed and Production: She's able to balance technical requirements with the practicalities of our current workflow."
