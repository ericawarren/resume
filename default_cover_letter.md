I love solving workflow and business intelligence problems, helping people work more efficiently and make better decisions.

Maybe the right solution is a custom software package (I love to code!), but maybe it's a third-party program, or a more streamlined process, a staff training program, or help increasing communication between departments. The "right" solution is the one that delivers results; let's make computers do the things they are good at, so we can free up people to do the things *they* are good at.

I have experience in all aspects of the process: discovery and gathering user requirements, development, creating documentation and training materials, conducting live training sessions, providing ad-hoc support, responding to user feedback, etc.
